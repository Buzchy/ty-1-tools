RKV Extract is a windows command-line application for extracting the contents of Krome Studios' proprietary RKV archives.

### Usage
RKV Extract is a command-line application.

Open a Command Prompt in the directory of `rkv-extract.exe`. The command parameters are as so:
```sh
rkv-extract.exe <in_file.rkv> <out_path>
```

If `rkv-extract.exe` is placed within the Ty 1 game directory, the following command would extract the contents of `Data_PC.rkv` into `Resource\Data_PC`.
```sh
rkv-extract.exe "Data_PC.rkv" "Resource\Data_PC"
```

### Build requirements
* Visual Studio 2015

### Building
1. Open [rkv-extract solution](rkv-extract.sln)
2. Build the project

### How it works
Krome Studios developed a proprietary archive file format for Ty the Tasmanian Tiger. It's straightforward and unencrypted. The approximate file format is below.
```
RKV Archive
â”‚   Data Block                   ; Contains the contents of all files
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€File Entry Block             ; Contains a collection of file entries
â”‚      File Name                 ; Name of the file (not a path)
â”‚      File Size                 ; Size of the file
â”‚      Directory Entry Index     ; Index of the parent directory with the Directory Entry Block
â”‚      Data Block Offset         ; Pointer to file contents in Data Block
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€Directory Entry Block        ; Contains a collection of directory entries
â”‚      Directory Path            ; Directory path (i.e. "Shaders\")
â”‚   
â”‚   File Count                   ; Number of entries in File Entry Block
â”‚   Directory Count              ; Number of entries in Directory Entry Block
```
